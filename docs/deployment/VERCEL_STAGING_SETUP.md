# 🎯 Vercel Staging Setup - Simple Guide

## 🚀 Your Staging is Already Live!

**Good news**: Your staging environment is already deployed and working!

**Staging URL**: https://contestlet-frontend-pr9zvd70q-matthew-reeds-projects-89c602d6.vercel.app

## 🔧 What Environment Variables Mean

Environment variables tell your app important settings like:
- **API URL**: Where to connect to your backend
- **Environment Type**: Is this staging or production?

## 📋 Current Status

Your staging app is currently using:
- **Default API URL**: Probably `http://localhost:8000` (from your .env file)
- **This means**: It will try to connect to localhost, which won't work from the deployed site

## ✅ Easy Fix Options

### **Option 1: Test with Local Backend (Easiest)**
If your backend is running on your computer:
1. **Keep backend running**: `python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000`
2. **Test locally first**: http://localhost:3002 
3. **Verify everything works** before worrying about remote setup

### **Option 2: Set API URL via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com/matthew-reeds-projects-89c602d6/contestlet-frontend
2. **Click**: Settings → Environment Variables
3. **Add**:
   - **Name**: `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://your-backend-url.herokuapp.com` (or wherever your backend is)
   - **Environment**: Production

### **Option 3: Skip Environment Setup for Now**
Just test the staging URL as-is to see:
- ✅ Does the site load?
- ✅ Do the UI components work?
- ✅ Does the timezone logic work?
- ❌ API calls will fail (expected without backend URL)

## 🧪 What to Test Right Now

### **Immediate Testing (No Backend Needed)**
1. **Visit**: https://contestlet-frontend-pr9zvd70q-matthew-reeds-projects-89c602d6.vercel.app
2. **Check**: 
   - ✅ Site loads properly
   - ✅ Responsive design works
   - ✅ Navigation works
   - ✅ Forms display correctly

### **With Backend (Needs Setup)**
1. **Login to admin** - Needs API connection
2. **Contest management** - Needs API connection
3. **Winner selection** - Needs API connection

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### **Immediate (5 minutes)**
1. **Test staging URL** - See if basic site works
2. **Compare with local** - Does it look the same?
3. **Check console** - Look for any obvious errors

### **When Ready for Full Testing**
1. **Set up backend URL** in Vercel dashboard
2. **Test API integration** 
3. **Verify contest fixes** work in staging

- **Your Staging Site**: https://contestlet-frontend-pr9zvd70q-matthew-reeds-projects-89c602d6.vercel.app
- **Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/matthew-reeds-projects-89c602d6/contestlet-frontend
- **Local Development**: http://localhost:3002

## ❓ What Should I Do Now?

**Simple answer**: Just visit your staging URL and see how it looks! 

The main goal was to get a staging environment where you can test the timezone fixes and delete functionality. Even without the backend connected, you can verify the frontend is working properly.
