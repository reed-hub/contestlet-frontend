# üö® Backend CORS Fix Required - Public Contest Entry Blocked

## **Issue Summary**
Public contest entry endpoints are blocked by CORS policy in local development, preventing users from entering contests.

## **Error Details**
```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:8000/contests/1/enter' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' 
has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

POST http://localhost:8000/contests/1/enter net::ERR_FAILED 500 (Internal Server Error)
```

## **Affected Functionality**
- ‚ùå **Public contest entry** (`/contests/{id}/enter`)
- ‚ùå **Contest authentication** (users cannot submit phone numbers)
- ‚úÖ **Admin endpoints** (working fine - different CORS config)

## **Testing Confirmed**
- **Backend Status**: ‚úÖ Healthy and responding
- **localhost:3000**: ‚ùå CORS blocked
- **localhost:3002**: ‚ùå CORS blocked
- **CORS Headers**: ‚ùå Not present for any localhost origin

## **Required Fix**
**Add localhost development origins to CORS middleware:**

```python
# Update CORS configuration to include localhost origins
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=[
        "http://localhost:3000",     # Standard React dev port
        "http://localhost:3002",     # Current frontend dev port
        # ... keep existing production origins
    ],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

## **Impact**
üî¥ **HIGH PRIORITY** - Core contest functionality completely broken in local development

## **Notes**
- Admin endpoints work fine (different CORS config?)
- This affects public-facing contest entry, not admin functions
- Similar to previous staging CORS issues we resolved

---
**Expected Result**: Users can successfully enter contests from `localhost:3000/3002` after CORS fix is deployed.
